# MLMC-SDE-PROJECT
Each project folder contains a different combination of:
  (1) stochastic time-stepping method (e.g. Euler-Maruyama, Milstein, Drift Split-Step Backwards Milstein),
  (2) mathematical model (e.g. Exchange Option Price Model, Gene Transcription Chemical Langevin Equations, a stiff test system), and 
  (3) type of MLMC (i.e. regular MLMC and antithetic MLMC).  
  
Common files for all simulation stored at the root folder level.  

Special thanks to Dr. Mike Giles of Oxford University for his MLMC convergence tests, which were used for each combination for a variety of parameter values.
